I’m a parent of two autistic children (10 & 9 years old, both non-speaking).  
AAC systems are often expensive and closed, but they don’t have to be.

**Our simple wish:**  
Every child and family deserves real, accessible choices.  
Communication is the bridge between hearts.

This is a non-profit, parent-led project.  
Feel free to share with anyone who might need it.
